                                Sudoku Online is the world's first (and probably only) cross-platform Desktop application that supports networked multiplayer. While there are many features, here are the notable ones:<br><br>
                            </h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Play classic Sudoku, with Notes, Hints, etc.</li>
                                <li>Play online with as many players as you wish</li>
                                <li>Drop-In/Drop-Out play style means players can join and leave when they wish</li>
                                <li>Board generation means player's can ask the game for a random board or upload their own</li>
                                <li>In-Game chat means players can constantly stay connected, and even chat after the game is over</li>
                                <li>Cross platform - All the platform needs is a screen and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</li>
                                <li>Automatically scales the window to fit any device</li>
                                <li>Has native binaries for Windows and macOS</li>

                                Sudoku Online was a labor of love. It was originally made so that a certain young lady and I could keep in touch while I studied abroad, but I'm happy to report that it's been used even outside of this context. This project was born out a "I wonder if
                                this is even possible..." thought. I have, of course, since found out that <em>it is indeed possible</em>.

                                Writing this application actually taught me quite a bit about the Java Programming Language and how modern networking works. Ideas like sockets, servers, and streams were introduced to me for the very first time. Multithreaded programming became second
                                nature. Overall, I actually learned more creating this than I learned in my classes!
